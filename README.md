## Inspiration
In next 5 years, Virtual Reality will become the next Common Interface for everything. Applying VR in education will help augment the 'real' experience, interaction and help students understand lectures better.

If a picture is worth thousand words, then we believe VR can tell you the whole story.

## What it does
VirtualBook is an open platform where people can contribute/submit their knowledge as lectures/slides in supported 3D VR models and others can use them for educational purposes.

## The platform includes
- Open platform for open contributors to harness the power of the crowd
- Universal format for all types of 3D lectures
- iPad app for experience-rich presentation
